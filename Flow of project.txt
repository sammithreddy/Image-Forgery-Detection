1.Data Collection:
	Here for this project we are using images as dataset
	the images like Fake and real images of humans
2.Data preprocessing
	It is a process of reshaping all the images into same size of images
3.Splitting of dataset
	Train
	Test
4.Model implementation
	Deep Learning model
		MobileNet Algorithm
5.Training the model and saving the trained model into a model file as h5/m5 file
6.Predicting test accuracy
7.Predicting classification report and confusion matrix
8.Final prediction:
	Testing with single images and predicting the accuract with Fake or Real Images
